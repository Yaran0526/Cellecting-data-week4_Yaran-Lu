# Cellecting-data-week4_Yaran-Lu

I used the dataset used for this week's lab: the Pudding's Film Dialogue Data. 
In this dataset, I focused on the changes in and characteristics of the share of lines for female characters, using the year 2000 as a dividing line. 
In Q3, I created a scatterplot of this question.


## Here are three questions from the assignmentï¼š
### Q1:
Sort the proportion_of_dialogue for female characters prior to 2000 in descending order and calculate the average. Then examine the first 20 rows.
### Q2:
Sort the proportion_of_dialogue for female characters after 2000 in descending order and calculate the average. Then examine the first 20 rows. And comparing the results of Q1 and Q2, what conclusions can be drawn?
### Q3:
Draw a scatter graph to show the change in the proportion of female characters' lines over the two time periods, with release_year on the X-axis and proportion_of_dialogue on the Y-axis.
